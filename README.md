# Overview 

In the modern world, every business is looking for how to optimize the working process and when it comes to workload optimization it is not as advanced and well organized as the other fields. Dozens of workers are facing the issue of quickly finding someone to replace them for the upcoming shift. As well as managing their tasks and deadlines. When people are working in big companies, most likely they will be required to download at least five apps and register in multiple web services. How many more different organizational software is used by HR and other departments? The entire process is currently inefficient and requires a new system to be put in place to combine all the current organizational software in one, thus it will ease parts of it, and help organize it both for employees and employers. 
 

# Background 

Right now, there are a few companies that have already created more advanced optimization tools, for example, Homebase, they have schedules, chat between teams and payment options, plus there are some extra small features. But let us take a closer look at the small delivery business that is currently using Homebase. Other than Homebase they are also using: 

- Onfleet for task tracking and delivery routine  

- Google docks to share all the information and spreadsheets 

- WhatsApp for better communication and photo sharing 

- Also using messages for direct communication 

- Excel for more detailed workers' personal information 

Workers cannot switch shifts online; they are required to call the manager to do it manually. Our web service will aim to eliminate this mess of different applications and services for better organization and optimization. 
 

# Needs 

At present, many of the best methods or programs used for managing employee shift details are basic spreadsheets and texting apps, nothing more. While this is clearly functionally adequate, there are multiple ways to improve and/or optimize such basic systems. Some examples are better readability and usability, higher detailed employee shift data, and dedicated areas for employee-to-employee or employee-to-employer feedback and communication. By not having these different functions in one centralized app, productivity for companies across the industry spectrum is inherently suboptimal. 
 

# Objective 

The goal of our system is to create an application that provides a single access point to the various functions required for company shift management and communication. By creating this application, it is our goal that the efficiency of companies across several fields will see a marked improvement. Results should appear in a decrease of time required for both employee management and error identification/correction. By having a single centralized application for the different functions, there should also be a decreased likelihood of repetitious information/data. Our system will provide all of this within a package that will be easy to learn and utilize. 
 

# Features 

- Public and general chat between members of one organization. 

- Page with members' detailed information (for management). 

- A list of employee tasks and associated shifts (for management). 

- Pages for creating, viewing, updating or deleting tasks and details. 

- Pages for viewing shifts and assigned tasks (for employees). 

- The ability for employees to drop and claim upcoming shifts from the list of open shifts. 

- The ability for tasks and associated shifts to be scheduled for repetition.  

- A page for opening new tasks and subtasks. 

- Schedule generator for shift selection by employees. 

 

# Why is this a substantial project? 

The project will be a standalone web platform and website that manages an internal database to make the life of both the employee and employer easier by eliminating the need to constantly use different applications to check schedules, check upcoming tasks and inter-team communication. Creating the platform will require an extensive design process, implementing reliable server and backend systems, and designing our database model. Additionally, we will be designing limited maintenance systems so they can run with less complicated code and minimal dependencies on third-party services. 

The system will be practical for small and big businesses and will allow for better organization and increased productivity.
